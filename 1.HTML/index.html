	<p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and is the largest of the
	terrestrial planets. Unlike the other planets in the solar system that are named
	after classic deities the Earth’s name comes from the Anglo-Saxon word erda
	which means ground or soil. The Earth was formed approximately 4.54 billion
	years ago and is the only known planet to support life.</p>
